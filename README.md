Citizen AI is an intelligent citizen engagement platform designed to revolutionize how governments interact with the public. Leveraging Flask, IBM Granite models, and IBM Watson, Citizen AI provides real-time, AI-driven responses to citizen inquiries regarding government services, policies, and civic issues. The platform integrates natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis to assess public sentiment, track emerging issues, and generate actionable insights for government agencies. A dynamic analytics dashboard offers real-time visualizations of citizen feedback, helping policymakers enhance service delivery and transparency. By automating routine interactions and enabling data-driven governance, Citizen AI improves citizen satisfaction, government efficiency, and public trust in digital governance.
